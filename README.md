## Hi there, I am Rumen! I am in my final year at the Technical University of Sofia, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer and Software Engineering, and I am also studying Java Development at the Software University in Sofia, Bulgaria. 👋

🔭 I am currently working on my final project for university. You can have a look here: https://github.com/runikolov01/RecycleRewards . It is a web-based application to encourage users to recycle plastic bottles.

🔍 I am looking for an internship or Junior position for Java web developer.
